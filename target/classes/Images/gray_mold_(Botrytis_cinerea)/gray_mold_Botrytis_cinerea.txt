<h3>MANAGEMENT</h3>The extended flowering period of pomegranates makes bloom treatments for gray mold uneconomical and the fruit crown that covers the blossom prevents the use of preharvest sprays. However, postharvest treatments can be very effective.Good orchard management practices, such as dust control and sanitation (removal of old fruit and dead branches), will reduce the postharvest incidence of disease.Storing pomegranates properly can help avoid further decay by disease. The optimal postharvest storage temperature for pomegranates is 41째F (5째C) for up to two months and 45째F (7째C) for longer than two months. Store at 90 to 95% relative humidity. If storing for longer than three months, a controlled atmosphere of 5% oxygen plus 15% carbon dioxide is suggested.
